      <h2 class="section-title">‚ú∂ Who Am I</h2>
      <p class="section-text">
        I'm not your typical dev. My background isn't certified by institutions ‚Äî it's burned into my DNA by nights in
        terminal windows,
        private CTF battles, working at amazon customer service as a customer service associate and poking through
        networks when others were asleep. I specialize in offensive security,
        reverse engineering, and low-level hacking. Frontend isn't my strong suit ‚Äî but this site proves I can build
        what I need, when I need it.Everything i learnt was available out there for free  totally open source my brother in arms and seniors have made it possible and
        <br> I would like this oppurtunity to express my respect for the seniors who have brought us so many
        beautifull things and wanna ask for more oppurtunities to grow I do wanna break into Tech & Cyber Security so if
        you want to collaorate with me or want to hire me please feel free to contact devSploit is always open to learning oppurtunities.

      <h2 class="section-title">üß† Mindset & Philosophy</h2>
      <p class="section-text">
        I believe in pure merit. If I can't break it, I don't understand it. If I can't build it, I shouldn't break it.
        Code is war,
        and every system is a fortress waiting to be tested. I bring the same energy to writing backend APIs as I do
        disassembling firmware in hex editors.
